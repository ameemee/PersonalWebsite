# Welcome to Amy's Website.

To run the app in the project directory, use: `npm start`.

There are more thins I want to do with this project. Here's a backlog of tasks:
1. There's a bug (can you spot it?) â€” dark/light mode doesn't instantly toggle sandwich bar change
2. Add transitions with Nav Link redirections
3. Adjust text styling on the mobile nav view
4. Add Amy's Cover Letter + Resume in the Nav Bar
5. Add "internal" scrolling to the accordion panels. ie. the ability to scroll in the accordion component without scrolling down the entire page allows for a better viewing experience + shorter accordions

Do you have any more suggestions? Message me on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amyzhuo/)**! ðŸ’Œ
